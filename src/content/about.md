Hi! I’m Toby, and I am a Senior Software Development Engineer at Adobe, specialising in building and maintaining reliable, scalable systems in the cloud. My current focus is on AEM Cloud Service, where I work on performance optimisation, automation, observability, and incident response.

I have a strong background in Python, Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, and React, as well as infrastructure and DevOps tools like Kubernetes, Docker, Prometheus, and CI/CD pipelines. I’m especially passionate about observability and monitoring—designing systems that not only surface the right metrics but make them understandable and actionable.

I enjoy turning complex datasets into clear, engaging visualisations that tell a story, whether that’s tracking production health or showing live race telemetry. Outside of work, I’m passionate about Formula 1, often combining my love for racing with tech projects.

Whether it’s delivering production-ready software, experimenting with new technologies, or diving into a creative side project, I bring curiosity, attention to detail, and a drive to continuously improve.

I have some projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/TobySuch) to explore, and if you would like to reach me, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobysuch/) is the best place to connect.
