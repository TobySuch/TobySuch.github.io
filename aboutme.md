Hi! My name is Toby. I graduated with a first in computer science in the summer of 2020 and I'm currently working at Adobe as an AEM Cloud Subject Matter Expert.

I love all things computers including building, programming, gaming on them. However when I do get up from my desk I enjoy building things, dungeons and dragons and fencing!

### Programming

I mostly program in Python and I am a huge fan of the [Django Web Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/). At work I am mostly involved in automation tasks, creating reports and user support so when I'm off the clock I like to create things! I've worked on many different things from websites to games to command line tools to solve problems I come across. Some of these are available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/TobySuch)!

I'm proficient in many software engineering techniques and software such as:
- Python 3
- Django
- Git
- Test Driven Development
- Windows, Linux and Mac OS
