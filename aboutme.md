Hi! My name is Toby. I graduated with a first in computer science in the summer of 2020, and currently I am working as a Software Development Engineer at Adobe.

I love all things computers including building, programming, gaming on them. However when I do get up from my desk I enjoy building things, dungeons and dragons and fencing!

I mostly program in Python and I am a huge fan of the [Django Web Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/). I've worked on many different things from websites to games to command line tools to solve problems I come across. Some of these are available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/TobySuch)! I also self host and manage some applications within my network such as [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and I enjoy tinkering with any smart devices I can get my hands on.

I'm proficient in many software engineering techniques and software such as:
- Python 3
- Django
- Git
- Test Driven Development
- Windows, Linux and Mac OS
